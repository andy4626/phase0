/*
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
The most important thing is writing down the correct syntax and choosing the correct directory for the CSS.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
I did not do any tricks.  It was simple trial and error.  If it didn't look like as is, I would twick with the width, height and more to looks like as is.  It was extremely hard to position everything, especially the unlisted orders.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
I used, color, background-color, margin, display, width, height, text-align,float, and clear.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
Yes, I added extra divs to select the tabs that I wanted to select.  I had to add a lot of br to put a little breathing space in between the texts also.  The divs were the most frequently used tabs of all.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
My site looks more compllicated and way more outdated.  It looks like a website from the 90s.  My code looks messy but it is organized.  My pair was able to follow along while he was navigating.
