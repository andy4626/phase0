How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
I can use Devtools inspector to preview any changes that are made with positions and colors of interest.  I can basically preview any changes that I want to make and see how they look before actually incorporating them into the CSS file itself.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
I can resize my elements by using font-size if it's a text, or height and width of a tab.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static is the default of the positioning, it is not affected by top, bottom, left or right.  It is positioned as the flow of the html itself.  Relative is positioned to its normal position by it is affected by top, bottom, left or right.  Absolute is literally absolute, it moves according to the page scrolling and it has no positioned ancestor, meaning other factors won't matter into absolute positioning.  Fixed, however, is positioned relative to the viewpoint. It will be at the same positioned if the page is scrolled up or down.  It is fixated at that position.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
The order goes from padding, border, and margin.  This is positioned as in from inside to outside.  Padding is the space between the text and the border.  Border is the space between actual margin and padding.  Margin is the outermost shell of the text which dictates the space between the text or image next to it.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I loved doing first 7 challenges because simple trial and error solved our problems with our previous knowledge.  But when we got to 8th challenge, our previous knowledge didn't work.  But after about one hour or research we were able to mess around with default values and get to the answer.  Exercise 9 was interesting too because we had to move around the div tabs with em's which was interesting.
