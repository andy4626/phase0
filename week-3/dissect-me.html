<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used article tag because I was writing down the actual blog which is an article. Other than that, no other HTML5 tags were used

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
The contents between the body gets laid out on a page.  The head will show basic description of the website and the body will show its actual content.  I don't get the question by what order it displays the elements because CSS can totally shift those elements. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I think I will keep creating snippets if I think they're necessary in the future.  But at first, I will stick to no snippets so I can practice.  My pair was HTML and CSS expert and was using so much shortcuts that he forgot some syntax, so I think sticking with basic no snippet will be a good practice for me

    <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
    <p>
      Version control will let you save your changed data points when working in group projects of coding.  It is sort of like checkpoints when you're playing games.  It will let you go back if you mess up the current versions and it will let you start from the checkpoint that you desire.

    <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
    <p>
        Git helps me keep track of changes by 'commit'.  Commit is sort of like the actual 'checkpoint' of the games.  It will keep a log of the changes, including the person and email of the editor and more.      </p>
    <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
    <p>
        
        GitHub is an open source version control website which lets everyone have access to your code and allow their comments or changes be on it.  It will let you work on projects with your peers or co-workers and have simulatenous changes on it without interfering with one another.
