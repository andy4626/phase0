Release 1:
What are these methods doing?
They are making a new instance_of_profile that the class Profile was applied upon.
The methods were changing and printing the the instance variable that was set within the class.  

How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
They are setting the newly changed instance variable with the newest input by using the methods 
and returning the newly modified value.

Release 2:
What changed between the last release and this release?
There is a new attr_reader :age on line 5 and got rid of what_is_age method because it can be called 
by attr_reader attribute

What was replaced?
Telling what age the person is has been changed.  NEw attr_reader will replace that function.

Is this code simpler than the last?
Yes, it got rid of a whole set of code for a simple one liner attribute method.

Release 3:
What changed between the last release and this release?
A new attr_writer has been added on line 6.  No method involving age can be spotted.

What was replaced?
Any method talking about age has been removed.

Is this code simpler than the last?
Yes, it is shorter and refactored.  It has gotten rid of methods involving age
