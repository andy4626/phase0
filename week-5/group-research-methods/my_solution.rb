# Person 4
def my_array_deletion_method(array, letter)
  array.delete_if {|x| x.to_s.include?(letter) }  
end

def my_array_deletion_method(array, letter)
  array.delete_if {|x| x.to_s==letter) }  
end
# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#I used a delete if method which deletes the selected item when the asking requirement is fulfilled.
#I also used to_s to change array element into a string and compare if the letter is there for me to delete
#Lastly, I used include? method to check if the selected element is containing a desired character

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
