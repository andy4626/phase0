- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was tough, but fun.  It felt satisfying seeing my result after all the struggles.  

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
After learning the HTML fundamentals from codeacademy and then doing it actual site was a good practice.  I don't think I used that much HTML5 elements for my berkshire site yet, but I looked and learned about it on the videos posted.  Posting the image in relative path was really tough it took more than 2 hours to figure out what was wrong with it

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I got the syntax wrong at first and I couldn't figure out why for a long time.  It was that I forgot one closing tab.  So after that mistake, I started opening and closing the tab before writing the materials down.  

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
Good thing is that it is very straight forward.  It shows my result on jsfiddle right away so it was fun seeing as I typed in the HTML and seeing the result right away.  I don't see anything bad as of now, but I think it will be complicated if CSS is involved next week.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Writing down all the necessary tabs before would be the best trick. (like !DOCTYPE, html and more) Just opening and closing syntax before writing down the materials will avoid any syntax confusion later on.  I also put all the texts down first and then added image and links to avoid any confusion later on.
