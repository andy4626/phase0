#1.1Think About Time
I learned a great time management strategy of breaking my tasks down into smaller units to make small habits to work more efficiently for harder or bigger tasks.  Time Boxing is setting a set time for doing a project and evaluating what I have done in that set time.  It will make me reflect at I can do and evaluate how much I get done and help me get 'in the zone'.  I think I manage time by pressuring myself by setting a deadline and finish it in time no matter what.  It works most of time, I actually get the work done but sometimes I make stupid little mistakes that results in beating myself down for it.  I will try to build smaller little habits to take some pressures off of me.  Time Boxing seems like a perfect strategy for my time management skills and I will try to incorporate them during Phase 0.
##1.2 The Command Line
A shell or 'bash' is one of the old interfaces used.  It is operated by command line interface where a command is given and the computer gives an output of the command.  The most challenging material for me was watching the video, it was so fast and I had no idea what the instructor was doing.  But after just pushing through the struggles, I saw the "Command Line Crash Course" and knew exactly what he was doing.  I was successfully able to use all of the commands, even though I was stuck many times.  I think the most important commands is the cd and ls command, because I gotta know which directory I'm working at and able to move around wherever I want to go.
-pwd -print working directory
-ls- list the files in the directory
-mv- move a directory 
-cd- change directory
-../- go back a directory/file
-touch-making a new empty file 
-mkdir- make a new directory
-less- view a file
-rmdir- remove a directory
-rm- remove a file
-help- ummm get help? or a manual
 
###1.4 Create, Fork, Clone Repositories
If I were to write instruction to create a new repo, I would tell them to first click the "+"(plus) sign on top right corner of the home webpage of GitHub and click on create a new repository.  I would tell them to write the new name of the repo and add a license of interest in the options.  If I were to write instruction to fork a repo, I would tell them to press the Fork button on top right corner of the repo of interest and select the account you want the fork to be in.  Then I would copy the URL or the HTTPS and type in 'git clone (copied HTTPS)' on the shell to clone the repo.  I would fork a repository instead of creating a new one because I want to get the lastly saved version of the repo, instead of starting from a new clean sheet.  I struggled getting access to the repo from my shell.  The video  seems like it can be done easily, but after cloning the repo(which I was able to do after many tries), I still couldn't get the Sublime version of the text files like the video.  I will probably work repetitively on it after just forcing myself through next exercises. I learned how to create, fork, and clone the repo as shown, but getting access after cloning the repo is still a working process.
