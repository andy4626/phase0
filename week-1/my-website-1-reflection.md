Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
You can create a repository by clicking a plus sign on the top right corner of the very front page of GitHub and create its name, and click the MIT license.  You can clone the repo by copying the HTTPS link on the right side and typing "git clone (copied HTTPS)".  

Describe what open source means.
Open source allows developers or anyone in general to gain the access or free license to the codes posted on open source websites.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think it is for the world to share its goods, but sometimes it will be an issue if there is a plagiarism issues or such.  It does not make me feel protective or nervous because I think I will also get benefits from Open Source.  It does feel like utopia where everyone is trying to make someone else better by sharing their codes.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
It is important to use licenses because it will allow us to have some set of rules in copying their codes and deal with issues later on

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
It was more than a day to pull up sublime text 2 from the iterm shell because subl . command wouldn't work.  So I searched online and so on but it didn't work.  So I emailed a tech support for iTerm and learned to type in some commands to gain access to sublime text2

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Yes, gaining access to sublime text2 from my shell was the greatest gain and pulling request workflow to GitHub was a MAJOR plus on me.  I was stuck on it for more than a day and was ready to give up.  But after many more tries, I was able to get it.
