Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?
git co master
git pull origin
git checkout feature-branch

git push origin feature-branch

What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?
Pull request is when the changes from my computer is sent to Github and make sure the other teammates or coworkers double check it before merging it. I create and merge it by clicking on the newly requested pull request and merge it with the master repository.
