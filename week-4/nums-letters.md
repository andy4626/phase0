How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby treats them like a calculator.  The numbers are going to be calculated correctly if put in with proper forms.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integer is a whole number without any decimals or fractions and float is a decimal/fraction number.

What is the difference between integer and float 
division?
Floats has the extra numbers after the decimal(the fractions of one)


What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are just the letters.  It will be the alphabetical inputs. The actualy typed letters, words, or sentences.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are the variables that are declared within the coding sequence.  It can be given a number, floats, strings, or booleans. And they can be used to calculate or input the information to the program for them to calculate or whatnot.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

Yes, it was fun going over the old materials that I was starting to forget slowly



What does puts do?

'Puts' prints out a result (can be integers, floats, strings, arrays, or booleans) on a console with a new line.

What is an integer? What is a float?

Integer is a whole number and float is a decimal number.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer is basically a whole number without any decimal points or fractions.  Float has a decimal point or a fraction.  So floats can be used to calculate numbers with great precision and accuracy where integer can used to estimate a large numbers or such.


```ruby
def hours_in_a_year
puts 52*7*24
end

def minutes_in_a_decade
puts 10*52*7*24*60
end
